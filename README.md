# ðŸ“˜ ML Models From Scratch: 1 Model Per Day

Welcome to my journey of learning Machine Learning by implementing **1 model per day from scratch** using Python and Numpy (and no ML libraries like sklearn for core logic). The goal is to understand how algorithms work under the hood and build a strong foundation.

---

## ðŸ§  Purpose

- Learn and implement ML models from scratch.
- No use of high-level ML libraries like `scikit-learn` for the model logic.
- Practice Python, math, and clean coding daily.

---

## ðŸ“… Daily Implementations

| Day | Model | Notebook |
|-----|-------|----------|
| 1   | Linear Regression | [Day01_Linear_Regression.ipynb](Day01_Linear_Regression.ipynb) |



> ðŸ“Œ Notebooks are fully commented and beginner-friendly.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

If you want to run the code locally:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas` (if used)

## ðŸ’¡ How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-models-from-scratch.git
   cd ml-models-from-scratch
